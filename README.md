# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data

* In this project, we built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset.
* The activation function used is sigmoid.
* The network was trained for 14900 epochs.
* Learning rate used is 0.18 which is fairly large.
* Used 1 hidden layer with 7 nodes.
* Was able to achieve a training loss of 0.067 and validation loss of 0.160 after 14900 epochs of training.
